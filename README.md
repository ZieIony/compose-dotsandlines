# compose-dotsandlines

Inspired by [this animation](https://nbasic.net/apps/particles.html) that I stumbled upon in /r/internetisbeautiful, this repository came to be. Almost the same animation implemented in Jetpack Compose with high customization. 

Full animation can be seen [here](https://youtu.be/iCe5f7L9vBg)
